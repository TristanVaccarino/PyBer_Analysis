# Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to help devolpers at pyber determine what steps can be taken to maximize profit of the ridesharing app.

## Results of Analysis

#### Fare by city type chart
Loooking at the image below we can see a stark difference in profit betweeen the 3 city types. Urban cities being at the top with the most profit, suburban being in the middle, and finally Urban profits being the least profitable city type.

#### Pyber Summary table
We will now move onto a table listing key information about each city type. Despite Urban cities pullling in the most amount of revenue they have the lowest average for fare per driver and fare per ride. This is due to the fact that the amount of drivers outnumbers the total rides whereas in both rural and suburban cities the total rides are higher than the amount of drivers.

## Summary
Below I will list 3 suggestions I have after analyzing this data as to make profits, employee and customer satisfaction that much better

#### Outreach
After looking at the summary i realized that the number of drivers in the Urban cities was twice that of the number of rides. I believe it would benefit/motivate your drivers if you spent more effort getting new customers and encourge existing ones to use your app more frequently.

#### Incentives
This brings me to my next point. If incentives were introduced to the Rural cities that could cause an influx of rides and drivers alike aking those areas more profitable.

#### Prices
To piggyback off the last suggestion, another way to increase profit is to drop the prices of rides in rural and even suburban areas so more people will be willing to ride.
